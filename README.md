## Training
DocTr consists of two main components: a geometric unwarping transformer (GeoTr) and an illumination correction transformer (IllTr).
- For geometric unwarping, we train the GeoTr network using the [Doc3D](https://github.com/fh2019ustc/doc3D-dataset) dataset.
- For illumination correction, we train the IllTr network based on the [DRIC](https://github.com/xiaoyu258/DocProj) dataset.

## Added training pipeline

dataset path structure
```
  DATASET_ROOT/
      -imgs/
        img files
      -uvs/
        uv files
```

to train the model

``` 
python train.py 
```

to change config, edit

```
    batch_size = 1
    num_epochs = 30
```

in `train.py`

## Inference 
1. Download the pretrained models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eZRxnRVpf5iy3VJakJNTKWw5Zk9g-F_0?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Cq9bfyAJ9MWwxj0CarqmKw?pwd=jmy1), and put them to `$ROOT/model_pretrained/`.
2. Geometric unwarping:
    ```
    python inference.py
    ```
3. Geometric unwarping and illumination rectification:
    ```
    python inference.py --ill_rec True
    ```

## Evaluation
- We use the same evaluation code as [DocUNet Benchmark](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/docunet.html) dataset based on Matlab 2019a. 
- Please compare the scores according to your Matlab version.
- Use the rectified images available from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kJ34Nk18RVPwYK8mdfcQvU_67whD9tMe?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Cq9bfyAJ9MWwxj0CarqmKw?pwd=jmy1) for reproducing the quantitative performance on the DocUNet Benchmark reported in the paper and further comparison.
